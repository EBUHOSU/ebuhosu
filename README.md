to whom it may concern. this individual is identified by their name, which is __. when it comes to the user, nicknames are totally acceptable. you question, why does this sound so upscale? well, we’ve also utterly got no idea! 

this file is also intended for patient testing. they should know the user or never, and they may or may not be patient! this user typically engages in risky interactions with one person first, but you can also have the guts to engage with the user! the user is a silly person who never loses their cool. although the user doesn't particularly appreciate being or leading the life of a fictional character, they wouldn't shun you if you were one! the user might even find you fascinating. however, in addition to creating fictitious names, the user also likes being called "__". the user enjoys being silly, you see!

this user is an artist as well! although it didn't happen right away, the user did enjoy drawing. spend a few minutes clicking on the one highlighted link beneath the user's bio. no forces, whether you like it or not!

the user makes no request to befriend a patient person! this is just a pointless concept from the user to waste your time, regardless of whether you want to get to know the user or not.
